This repository stores my solutions for Project Euler problems. The following
points must be made.

- I have made only token attempts at ensuring portability. The programs run
  correctly on my Mac OS X 10.6.4 system, and this is all I care about. You're
  insane if you think I'm going to learn Automake or something.

- These are demonstrations of neither programming prowess nor mathematical
  ingenuity, because I am incapable of both. The algorithms are not elegant;
  the code is not immaculately clean. The code (hopefully) produces the
  correct result, but very likely in an over-engineered manner.

- Exact-width and minimum-width integer variables are used often. I expect
  many -- if not most -- of them are used incorrectly.
