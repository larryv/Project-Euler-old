This repository stores my solutions for Project Euler problems. The following
points must be made.

- I have made only token attempts at ensuring portability. The programs run
  correctly on my Mac OS X 10.6.4 system, and this is all I care about.

- These are not demonstrations of either programming prowess or mathematical
  ingenuity, because I am capable of neither. The algorithms are not elegant;
  the code is not immaculately clean. The code (hopefully) produces the
  correct result, but very likely in an over-engineered manner.

- Exact-width integer variables are used pervasively. I expect many of them
  are used incorrectly, if not most of them.
